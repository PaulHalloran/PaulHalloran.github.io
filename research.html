              style="font-size: 10pt;">The seas are changing. Marine
              conservation seeks to protect valuable habitats but the
              pristine state of marine ecosystem
              functioning and biodiversity – that is, the system as it
              operated before there was any large scale human impact –
              is
              conjectural. Conservation management strategies are often
              based on highly altered ecosystems where the degree of
              human-induced change is unknown. In SEACHANGE, we propose
              a structured and systematic approach to the
              reconstruction of marine ecosystem baselines to quantify
              the impact of anthropogenic cultural transitions on marine
              biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. SEACHANGE will
              address two key questions: 1) What was the nature of
              long-term
              changes in prehistoric marine biodiversity and ecosystem
              functioning over a 3000-year period in NW Europe and the
              degree
              of human impact associated with major socioeconomic
              changes across the Mesolithic-Neolithic boundary? 2) What
              has
              been the scale and rate of marine biodiversity loss and
              changes to ecosystem functioning as a result of fishing
              intensity and
              marine habitat loss during the last 2000 years (including
              the Industrial Transition) in the North Sea and around
              Iceland,
              eastern Australia and the west Antarctic Peninsula? To
              address these questions we will analyse: 1)
              absolutely-dated
              annually-resolved bivalve shell series
              (“sclerochronologies”); 2) marine sediment cores; 3)
              archaeological midden (waste)
              materials including shells and bones. We will date these
              samples precisely and undertake zooarchaeological and
              palaeoecological, stable isotope geochemical and
              environmental DNA/DNA metabarcoding analyses. We will
              compare the
              data with historical and archival sources, and we will
              generate numerical ecosystem simulations. We will identify
              how
              depleted the current marine environment is compared with
              that before large scale human impact and what measures are
              needed, and how long will it take, for marine biodiversity
              to recover.

        <h2>CURB CO<sup>2</sup>: Carbon Uptake Revisited – Biases
          Corrected using Ocean Observations</h2>
        <h2> </h2>
        <p>When we emit carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the
          atmosphere through industrial activity, only around half of
          that CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the atmosphere, with the
          remainder being taken up approximately equally through
          photosynthesis by plants on land and being absorbed by the
          oceans. These anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> 'sinks' are
          essentially saving us from a large part of the global warming
          that we would otherwise be experiencing. New evidence suggests
          that our estimates of how this fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> that
          stays in the atmosphere is changing, and will continue to
          change, may be too high, meaning that there may be more hope
          that we can prevent atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
          rising too high than was previously thought.<br>
          <br>
          Whilst we can estimate how much CO<sub>2</sub> we are
          presently emitting, and can measure the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>
          in the atmosphere, and therefore work out how strong these
          sinks are (i.e. how much CO<sub>2</sub> they are taking out of
          the atmosphere), we must calculate how this number will change
          in the future if we are to determine how much CO<sub>2</sub>
          we can emit as a society without exceeding dangerous CO<sub>2</sub>
          concentrations in the atmosphere. This project aims to give us
          a better understanding of what this future change in the
          fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> staying in the atmosphere is, by
          correcting a bias we have identified in the models we use to
          make these projections.<br>
          <br>
          We make projections of how the land and ocean CO<sub>2</sub>
          sinks may change in the future using increasingly
          comprehensive Earth System Models (which are climate modes
          which also contain a representation of additional processes
          such as the carbon cycle). While these models are the best
          possible tools we have to simulate future climate change, they
          are still far from perfect. We have shown that in the North
          Atlantic, which is the most intense ocean CO<sub>2</sub> sink,
          these models underestimate how quickly the CO<sub>2</sub>
          absorption is increasing, and have identified what the models
          are doing wrong. This project will extend this work from the
          North Atlantic to the full ocean, and by correcting for the
          biases that cause the models to under-predict this change,
          produce new and improved future estimates of ocean CO<sub>2</sub>
          absorption.<br>
          <br>
          One we have our improved estimates of future changes in the
          strength of the ocean carbon sink, we will account for how the
          land CO<sub>2</sub> sink responds to this, and produce a set
          of new scenarios describing how much CO<sub>2</sub> can be
          emitted through human activity through time if we are not to
          exceed the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations linked to
          global warming of 1.5 to 2 degrees C above preindustrial
          temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          The overarching aim of this project is to provide UK and
          international governments with the best possible impartial
          information from which they can plan how best to work towards
          the global warming targets (the 'Paris Agreement') set at the
          Paris Climate Conference in December 2015.</p>

        <h2>Robust Spatial Projections of Real-World Climate Change</h2>
        <h2> </h2>
        <p>Robust Spatial Projections of Real-World Climate Change is a
          four year project led by Mat Collins (Exeter, CEMPS),
          including partners from Exeter, BAS, UEA, Reading, Oxford and
          the Met Office, aiming to bring together dynamical and
          statistical approaches to produce 'real-world' climate
          projections, rather than model-world climate projections.
          Within this Halloran's group will be trying to understand the
          sensitivity of the climate system (and specifically land-sea
          temperature contrasts) to marine emissions of
          biologically-produced trace gasses.&nbsp;</p>

          is a Large (£2M) NERC funded directed program.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The project's object is to understand how large, and how
          variable, are sources and sinks of greenhouse gases to the
          atmosphere from the North Atlantic. We aim to be able to
          describe how these have changed in the recent past and how
          they will change in the future under different climate
          scenarios. Most effort will be concentrated on carbon dioxide,
          and we will deliver a comprehensive budgeting of natural and
          anthropogenic components of the carbon cycle in the North
          Atlantic and understanding of why the air-sea fluxes of CO2
          vary regionally, seasonally and multi-annually. Observations
          of CH4 and N2O and estimates of their regional fluxes will
          additionally be made. We, in collaboration with our partner
          institutions in Europe and the US, will undertake surface
          measurements of CO2 air-sea fluxes made from networks of
          voluntary observing ships and at fixed sites. These will be
          synthesised with observations from hydrographic sections of
          the interior carbon content. We will thus obtain accurate
          estimates of the uptake, present storage, and net transport of
          anthropogenic carbon, and variability in the natural uptake
          and release of atmospheric CO2 by the N. Atlantic. In parallel
          with direct estimates made from these observations, forward
          and inverse models (of both atmospheric and oceanic kinds) of
          these fluxes will be developed.<br>

        <h2>ABC Fluxes<br>
        </h2>
        <h2> </h2>
        <p>ABC Fluxes is a Large (£1.2M) NERC funded directed program
          which makes up part of the NERC <a
            href="http://www.rapid.ac.uk/amoc/research.php">RAPID</a>
          programme.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The North Atlantic Ocean plays a pivotal role in the global
          carbon cycle, by storing carbon released into the atmosphere
          when fossil fuels are burned, and by supporting the sinking
          flux of organic matter. Our understanding of how horizontal
          oceanic fluxes in the subtropics contribute to these processes
          is largely based on shipboard expeditions which occur every 5
          years at 24N. Sampling at that interval is insufficient to
          resolve and understand the role that horizontal transfers play
          in regulating these processes.<br>
          Detailed time-series of physical properties at 26.5N from
          moored instruments suggest that variability in these fluxes
          will be occurring on a range of timescales. Once this
          variability is measured, it is almost inevitable that we will
          modify our understanding of the role the North Atlantic
          subtropical gyre plays in the global carbon cycle.</p>
        <p>In ABC fluxes we will address these issues by deploying new
          chemical sensors and samplers across the Atlantic at 26.5N. We
          will use the data they provide to calculate time-series of
          fluxes of nutrient and inorganic carbon, including carbon
          released to the atmosphere by mans activities, across 26.5N.
          We will adopt a hierarchical approach, successively using
          existing observations, then new oxygen observations and
          ultimately direct observations of the carbon and nutrients, in
          order to identify the added value each successive stage of our
          programme provides.</p>
        <p>We will interpret our direct flux calculations as
          contributions to the North Atlantic budget in conjunction with
          other observations and models, to assess how oceanic fluxes
          control the strength and variability of the role the North
          Atlantic plays in the global carbon cycle.<br>
