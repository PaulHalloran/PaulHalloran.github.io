          Systems Science and Geography disciplines, the Met Office

            src="images/me.jpg" align="left" hspace="10">Paul’s primary
          research interests focus on understanding the role of the
          marine carbon cycle within the Earth system. His
          multi-disciplinary background allows this to be tacked in a
          novel way. Paul’s degree and PhD were in the Department of
          Earth Sciences in Oxford, where working with Ros Rickaby, he
          examined ENSO change over the Pliocene, developed novel
          geochemical climate proxy techniques, and investigated the
          impact of ocean acidification on calcifying phytoplankton.
          After his PhD Paul moved to the Met Office Hadley Centre as a
          scientist, then senior scientist in ocean biogeochemical
          modeling. In the Hadley Centre Paul was heavily involved in
          the development, validation and application of the Earth
          System Model HadGEM2-ES. Working with this model, Paul and
          colleagues investigated the mechanisms behind novel
          biogeochemical climate feedbacks, the role of anthropogenic
          aerosols in recent climate change, reversibility in the earth
          system and more. In 2013 Paul took up a lectureship in the
          School of Geography, University of Exeter, becoming a senior
          lecturer in 2016, where he is working to unite past and future
          climate research to help improve our understanding of the
          Earth system.<br>

          of Washington, Seattle. Whilst in Seattle she took part in a
          student research cruise to Vancouver Island and collected data
          within Nootka Sound, a fjord system. She used this data to
          produce a thesis looking at the influence of coastal upwelling
          on the surface CO2 flux within the fjords. Once back in
          Southampton Gen completed her final year project looking at

        performing new HadGEM3 simulations to test hypotheses of the

          Alice Lebehot</span> (Lead supervison, Paul Halloran,
        co-supervisors, Andy Watson, Doug McNeall, Ute Schuster). Moved
        to Capetown to work with Pedro Monteiro. Alice worked on the
        RAGNARoCC project. Her work aims to understand how, and how
        well, Earth System models simulate observed North Atlantic pCO2
        variability, to help constrain our confidence in model
        projections of future CO2 uptake. Numerous observational
        campaigns and data from ships of opportunity over the past two
        decades have lead to the suggestion that modes of climate
        variability (NAO and AMO) dominate recent N. Atlantic air-sea
        CO2 flux changes (Thomas et al, 2008, Watson et al, 2009). Links
        between air-sea CO2 flux and the NAO and AMO, if robust, are
        extremely valuable because they allow mechanisms for changing
        CO2 uptake, verified in the real world, to be considered in the
        context of past and future natural and anthropogenic forcing. As
        promising as these relationships may seem, the observational CO2
        air-sea flux record spans less that one full cycle of the NAO‘s,
        and less than half a cycle of the AMO’s multi-decadal
        variability, and therefore our confidence in these relationships
        is very limited. We must therefore look to carefully validated
        models to extend our observational understanding and place
        observed changes in a future context. Alice also worked with us
        for 6 months on the NERC CURBCO2 project.<b><br>
