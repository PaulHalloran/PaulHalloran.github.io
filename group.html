        <p>Our group collaborates with colleagues across Exeter's Earth
          Systems
          Science and Geography disciplines, the Met Office Hadley

        <p><img style="width: 132px; height: 167px;" alt="Paul image"
            src="images/me.jpg" align="left" hspace="10">Paul’s primary
          research interests focus on understanding the role of
          the marine carbon cycle within the Earth system. His
          multi-disciplinary
          background allows this to be tacked in a novel way. Paul’s
          degree and
          PhD were in the Department of Earth Sciences in Oxford, where
          working
          with Ros Rickaby, he examined ENSO change over the Pliocene,
          developed
          novel geochemical climate proxy techniques, and investigated
          the impact
          of ocean acidification on calcifying phytoplankton. After his
          PhD Paul
          moved to the Met Office Hadley Centre as a scientist, then
          senior
          scientist in ocean biogeochemical modeling. In the Hadley
          Centre Paul
          was heavily involved in the development, validation and
          application of
          the Earth System Model HadGEM2-ES. Working with this model,
          Paul and
          colleagues investigated the mechanisms behind novel
          biogeochemical
          climate feedbacks, the role of anthropogenic aerosols in
          recent climate
          change, reversibility in the earth system and more. In 2013
          Paul took
          up a lectureship in the School of Geography, University of
          Exeter,
          becoming a senior lecturer in 2016,
          where he is working to unite past and future climate research
          to help
          improve our understanding of the Earth system.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alice Lebehot</span> (Lead
        supervison,
        Paul Halloran, co-supervisors, Andy Watson, Doug McNeall, Ute
        Schuster). Moved to Capetown to work with Pedro Monteiro. Alice
        worked
        on
        the RAGNARoCC project. Her work aims
        to understand how, and how well, Earth System models simulate
        observed
        North Atlantic pCO2 variability, to help constrain our
        confidence in
        model projections of future CO2 uptake. Numerous observational
        campaigns and data from ships of opportunity over the past two
        decades
        have lead to the suggestion that modes of climate variability
        (NAO and
        AMO) dominate recent N. Atlantic air-sea CO2 flux changes
        (Thomas et
        al, 2008, Watson et al, 2009). Links between air-sea CO2 flux
        and the
        NAO and AMO, if robust, are extremely valuable because they
        allow
        mechanisms for changing CO2 uptake, verified in the real world,
        to be
        considered in the context of past and future natural and
        anthropogenic
        forcing. As promising as these relationships may seem, the
        observational CO2 air-sea flux record spans less that one full
        cycle of
        the NAO‘s, and less than half a cycle of the AMO’s multi-decadal
        variability, and therefore our confidence in these relationships
        is
        very limited. We must therefore look to carefully validated
        models to
        extend our observational understanding and place observed
        changes in a
        future context. Alice also worked with us for 6 months on the
        NERC
        CURBCO2 project.<b><br>
