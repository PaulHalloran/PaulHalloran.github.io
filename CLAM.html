<h2>Climate of the LAst Millennium (CLAM): An Integrated Data-Model
Approach to Reconstruct and Interpret Annual Variability in North
Atlantic Circulation</h2>
<h2>
</h2>
<br />
<p>The ocean circulation of the North Atlantic is variable and pivotal
in controlling regional and global climate. This variability occurs
both naturally, and it is anticipated, in response to anthropogenic
activity. Internal and forced natural variability in this system has so
far largely been characterised in terrestrial archives and models
rather than in the real ocean. It is critical that we understand the
magnitude, timescale, drivers and impacts of this variability if we are
to correctly attribute observed trends in the North Atlantic
circulation, and develop robust early warning systems of, and plan
adaptation to, future change. In CLAM we aim to utilise a network of
robustly calibrated and verified absolutely dated sclerochronological
proxy archives from NW Scotland, N. Iceland and the Gulf of Maine,
together with high-resolution climate models, to investigate the
mechanisms and forcings driving variability in the circulation patterns
of the North Atlantic over the last millennium. This work builds on two
exciting pieces of research, the first which presents the first ever
annually resolved marine palaeoclimate record spanning the last 1000
years, and finds the ocean to be leading the land records throughout
much of this period (Reynolds et al., in review), and the second, which
brings this information together with the PMIP3 last millennium
simulations, to show that bivalves are recording GIN sea destiny
variability, that this is associated with AMOC change, and that this
AMOC change can explain much of the previously unexplained Atlantic
climate variability of the last Millennium (Halloran et al., in review). </p><br />
<p>The project is a collaborative effort between The Universities of
Exeter, Cardiff and Bangor, and the Met Office. At the University of
Exeter, we will be running idealised climate model simulations to
attribute the reconstructed variability to a variety of hypothesised
forcing mechanisms, quantifying the potential roles of salinity and
temperature in forcing the reconstructed oxygen isotope variability,
and using simulations of the last millennium to help interpret the
exciting new annually resolved Atlantic network of bivalve oxygen
isotope data.</p>
