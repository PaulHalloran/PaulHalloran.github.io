        <h2>Downscaling climate projections to coral reefs<br>
        </h2>
        <h2> </h2>
        <br>
        <p>Coral reef managers have become skilled users of tools like <a
            href="https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/index.php">Coral


            Reef Watch's</a> 5km resolution satellite-based coral heat
          stress products, yet planning for the impacts of climate
          change on coral reefs relies on the output of global climate
          models with resolutions of ~100km and which contain no
          representation of coastal processes. Statistical tools have
          been used to <a
            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39666">add detail
            to projections</a>, but they are doing so with no additional
          information about what is actually going on the coastal shelf,
          and simply assuming that the present day spatial patterns will
          persist into the future. Traditional cutting edge <a
            href="https://ereefs.org.au/ereefs">coastal models</a> are
          being used to understand processes and producing short-range
          projections, but they are too computationally expensive to run
          over the timescales we need, across the range of possible
          futures we may experience and across the spatial-scales needed
          to provide global-level joined-up guidance.<br>
        </p>
        <p>By stripping coastal models down to the essentials, and
          building back in those processes which are of 1st order
          importance we are developing a coastal model which can be run
          globally, can be run for decades or hundreds of years into the
          future, and can be run dozens or hundreds of times to explore
          scenario or forcing uncertainty.<br>
