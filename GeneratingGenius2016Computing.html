<h2>Generating Genius Computing Exercise<br>
</h2>

<p>These instructions will lead you through how to build your
temperature and humidity sensor.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h2>What is the Raspberry Pi computer that we will be using?</h2>
<br>
<li>A good introduction can be found <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/90103691?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=cccccc" target="_blank">here</a></li>
<li>The computer that we've lent each of you is a Raspberry Pi 3. The
figure below labels what some of the generic bits are:<br>
</li>
<ol>
  <h2> </h2>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 338px; height: 253px;" alt="sensor" src="images/GenGenius/pi.png"><br>
</ol>
<li>The Raspberry Pi has no power button, it switches on as soon as the
power cable is connected - so before we connect the power we need to
connect each of the following:
</li>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USB keyboard<br>
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USB mouse<br>
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethernet cable (connected at the
other end to a network socket<br>
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDMI cable connected at the other
end to TV or monitor<br>
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micro SD card<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>Once your Raspberry Pi is plugged in it will load to a screen
looking something like that below. Feel free to have a bit of a play
and get a feel for it - you will find
that it is very similar to what you are used to with any other
computer.
</li>
<ol>

</ol>
<br>
<h2>Setting up the sensor hardware</h2>
<br>
<li>Make sure that your Raspberry Pi has been shut down and is
unplugged from the power supply<br>
</li>
<br>
<li>We then need to plug the temperature and humidity sensor:<br>
</li>
<ol>
  <h2> </h2>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 338px; height: 253px;" alt="sensor" src="images/GenGenius/IMG_0631.JPG"><br>
</ol>
<li>into the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins:<br>
</li>
<ol>
  <h2> </h2>
  <br>
  <img style="width: 338px; height: 253px;" alt="sensor" src="images/GenGenius/gpio.png"><br>
</ol>
<li>These pins (or connectors) allow the Raspberry Pi to talk to and
receive input from the real world. The diagram below shows you what the
different pins are and names them. The ones that you will have to worry
about are the ones that output electric current at 3.3v (similar to a
battery), and any of the 'Ground' pins which are the points against
which the voltage to any other pin can be measured - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_%28electricity%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity)</a>.
In this situation we've chosen to use GPIO pin 4 (as well as the 3.3V
and ground pins).</li>
<ol>
  <h2> </h2>
  <br>
</ol>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" alt="sensor" src="images/GenGenius/gpio2.png">
<ol>
  <br>
</ol>
<li>The temperature/humidity sensor you've got is called a DHT22.</li>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Background: If
you are interested in the details about this sensor see </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/DHT22.pdf">here.</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> It measures temperature by measuring how
hard it is to push
electricity through a thermistor (a conductor that conducts better at
higher temperatures and worse at lower temperatures), it then measures
humidity by measuring how efficiently a special capacitor inside the
sensor can work - this works because moist air allows the charge held
by the capacitor to leak away. Rather than us having to convert the
resistance and capacitance within this sensor into a temperature and
humidity as we would have to do if this was an analogue sensor, the
DHT22 converts this information into a digital signal. This digital
signal is communicated to the Raspberry Pi by very briefly diverting
the current that was coming in from the 3.3v pin and out to the ground
pin, across to the middle (brown) wire coming out of the sensor. The
length and pattern of this voltage across the middle wire is encoding
the information about temperature and humidity. All we need to do
therefore is measure when there is a voltage change across out GPIO pin
on the Raspberry Pi and we can work out what the temperature and
humidity is - simple!</span><br>
<br>
<li>The sensor has a white, brown and purple wire soldered to it, then
three arbitrary coloured connector wires soldered to the ends of them:<br>
</li>
<ol>
  <h2> </h2>
  <br>
</ol>
<img style="width: 338px; height: 253px;" alt="sensor" src="images/GenGenius/IMG_0630.jpg">
<ol>
  <br>
</ol>
<li>The black bits on the end of the wires can slide over the Raspberry
Pi
GPIO pins to connect the sensor to the Raspberry Pi. You now need to
connect:<br>
  <ol type="I">
    <li>The white wire coming from the sensor to the 3.3v pin (see
diagram
above)<br>
    </li>
    <li>The brown wire coming from the sensor to the GPIO pin 4<br>
    </li>
    <li>The purple wire coming from the sensor to one of the ground pins<br>
    </li>
REMEMBER THAT THE COLOURED WIRES THAT PUSH ON TO THE GPIO PINS ARE
RANDOM COLOURS, IGNORE THE COLOURS OF THESE!<br>
  </ol>
It should look something like this:

  <ol>
    <br>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <h2>Setting up the software</h2>
</li>
<li>Make sure the ethernet cable is connected to your Raspberry Pi
(and to the wall), then plug in the power cable to started the
Raspberry Pi up...<br>
</li>
<br>
<li>To allow us to read data from the sensor, and store this data, we
need to install various pieces of software. To do this we need to open
the 'terminal', and type various commands in to this. The 'terminal'
window is our way of controling the computer powerfully - the image
below explains how to open it.<br>
</li>
<h2> </h2>
<br>
<img style="width: 450px; height: 253px;" alt="terminal" src="images/GenGenius/pi_desktop.png">
<ol>
  <br>
</ol>
<br>
<li>Next, type (or copy) the following in to the terminal, pressing
enter after each one. NOTE, read the output from each command, and if
it asks you a question type 'Y' to say 'yes', then press enter.<br>
</li>
<ul>
  <font color="red">
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd Adafruit_Python_DHT </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt-get upgrade </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt-get update </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo apt-get install
build-essential python-dev </li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo python setup.py install </li>
  </font>
</ul>
<li>You are now ready to run the downloaded software to see what
temperature and humidity the sensor is reading. Do this by typing: <br>
</li>
<ul>
  <font color="red">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudo python
/home/pi/Adafruit_Python_DHT/examples/AdafruitDHT.py
22 4 </font>
</ul>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Background: This is saying that as
a superuser (so that you have the correct
permissions) run a python script in the directory
/home/pi/Adafruit_Python_DHT/examples/ called AdafruitDHT.py, and feed
it two numbers, 22 is the name of the sensor (DHT22) and 4 is the
number of the GPIO pin it will be receiving the signal
on. Does it work? If not, go back and follow the instructions carefully
again to make sure that you have done everything exactly right!
If it does, well done! You've made your Raspberry Pi do something that
you could not make any normal computer, phone, tablet do without
buying some very expensive equipment! </span></div>

<h2>Setting up the final piece of software which will log the
temperature and humidity data</h2>
<li>We will start by downloading a script we've written for you to
make the measuremenst and upload them to the web. To download the
script, type the following in to your terminal (pressing enter after
each line):</li>
<ul>
  <font color="red">
  <li style="margin-left: 30px;">cd</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 30px;">wget
http://people.exeter.ac.uk/ph290/ftp/generating_genius.py </li>
  </font> <br>
  <li>Now
open the file in a text editor (a program to edit text - here it is
called leafpad, but think of this as an alternative to Microsoft Word)
by typing:</li>
  <ul>
    <font color="red">
    <li style="margin-left: 30px;">leafpad generating_genius.py </li>
    </font> <br>
    <li>Edit the file that says <font color="green">group = 'groupx'</font>
to contain the
number relating to your group e.g. <font color="green">group = 'group1'</font>,
save the file, then close the text editor<br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>We can now run this script by typing:</li>
    <ul>
      <font color="red">
      <li style="margin-left: 30px;">sudo python
generating_genius.py </li>
      </font> <br>
      <li>Can
you see the data appearing on the web here - but note that here will be
a delay of about a minute before this data starts appearing:</li>
      <ul>
